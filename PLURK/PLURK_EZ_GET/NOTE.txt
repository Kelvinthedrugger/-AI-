use "view_faces.py" to confirm the selected faces
e.g.,
    run "python view_faces.py 35 48"
    will print the message below:

        ['35', '48']
        35: ('ðŸ˜³', 'Flushed face')
        48: ('ðŸ˜«', 'Tired face')]

    the index represents which face to fetch
    , according to face_list.pkl
    , which is the same as the face list on
    google spread sheet (the dropbox url one)


then, run "Plurk_Steal_Data_smiling_face_with_open_mouth.py"
to fetch the data from plurk.com
i suppose it would be much faster since jupyter notebook is heavy

e.g.,
    first, change the index in "for face_idx in [35, 48]"
    to the index you want
    then, run "python Plurk_Steal_Data_smiling_face_with_open_mouth.py > record_blah.txt"
    to redirect the messages that should be printed
    to "record_blah.txt" file
