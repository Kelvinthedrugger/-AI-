Let's go MOFO! HARD HARD HARD

This github repo is mostly about the codes that we used in the competition
not really available to general public (it's our business secret LOL)

### twitter_sentiment_kaggle.zip

    Due to it's large size ( > 50 Mb, over the recommended size of git), if there's an problem, 

    a. fetch the local storage
    b. just visit the source (see notion)


### plurk dataset

    We're limited by the "30-day to generate a token" rule, so now, we can hardly  
    visit the web via scripts. Manually would work still, but that's not an option.


### twitter dataset

    I'm considering training a model from existing dataset (like, in this repo).
    And fetch some posts from the web just to show that our product has the ability to do so.

    ## progress

    Training officially provided model done: see Readme in emo_ds && notebook in emo_nbs
    Fetch from twitter: not even started
    Now working on: model backend (to communicate w/ frontend: get user input, etc)
